latex-base TODO list (sorted by priority)
=========================================

* Including vectorial images without passing through png
* Optional import for listings and tikz to reduce compilation times
* A script to update and create copies of the templates used in other projects
is needed.
	- something like diff3?
* Add a beamer template.
* Personaly, Makefiles suit me, but python script to compile documents might be
more extensible.
